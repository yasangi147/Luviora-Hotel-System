# Luviora-Hotel-System

📌 Project Description

This project is a web-based Hotel Management System developed as part of my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. The system aims to modernize traditional hotel operations by replacing manual processes with a fully digital, secure, and automated solution.

The application provides features such as online room booking, secure payment processing, automated room assignment, and QR code–based room access to enhance guest convenience and improve hotel operational efficiency. It also includes role-based dashboards for administrators and staff, real-time room availability management, and a centralized database for secure data handling.

The project focuses on improving guest experience, reducing staff workload, and supporting contactless services, making it especially suitable for small to medium-sized hotels adapting to digital transformation.
